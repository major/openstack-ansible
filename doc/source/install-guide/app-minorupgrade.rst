Appendix C.Â Minor Upgrades
--------------------------

Upgrades between minor versions of OpenStack-Ansible are handled by simply
updating the repository clone to the latest tag, then executing playbooks
against the target hosts.

A minor upgrade will typically require the execution of the following:

#. Change directory into the repository clone root directory

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # cd /opt/openstack-ansible

#. Update the git remotes

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # git fetch --all

#. Checkout the latest tag (the below tag is an example)

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # git checkout 13.0.1

#. Update all the dependent roles to the latest versions

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # ./scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh

#. Change into the playbooks directory

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # cd playbooks

#. Update the Hosts

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible setup-hosts.yml

#. Update the Infrastructure

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible -e rabbitmq_upgrade=true \
          setup-infrastructure.yml

#. Update all OpenStack Services

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible setup-openstack.yml

Note that if you wish to scope the upgrades to specific OpenStack components
then each of the component playbooks may be executed and scoped using groups.
For example:

#. Update only the Compute Hosts

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible os-nova-install.yml --limit nova_compute

#. Update only a single Compute Host. Note that skipping the 'nova-key' tag is
    necessary as the keys on all compute hosts will not be gathered.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible os-nova-install.yml --limit <node-name> \
          --skip-tags 'nova-key'

If you wish to see which hosts belong to which groups, the
``inventory-manage.py`` script will show all groups and their hosts.
For example:

#. Change directory into the repository clone root directory

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # cd /opt/openstack-ansible

#. Show all groups and which hosts belong to them

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # ./scripts/inventory-manage.py -G

#. Show all hosts and which groups they belong to

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # ./scripts/inventory-manage.py -g

You may also see which hosts a playbook will execute against, and which tasks
will be executed:

#. Change directory into the repository clone playbooks directory

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # cd /opt/openstack-ansible/playbooks

#. See the hosts in the nova_compute group which a playbook will execute against

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # openstack-ansible os-nova-install.yml --limit nova_compute \
                                              --list-hosts

#. See the tasks which will be executed on hosts in the nova_compute group

   .. code-block:: shell-session

     # openstack-ansible os-nova-install.yml --limit nova_compute \
                                             --skip-tags 'nova-key' \
                                             --list-tasks
